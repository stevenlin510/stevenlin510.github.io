I received my undergraduate degress at National Taiwan Normal University, and my advisor is [Chia-Hung Yeh](https://sites.google.com/site/chiahungyeh/). 
just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
